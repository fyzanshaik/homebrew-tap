  caveats <<~EOS
    Cachewatch releases may be distributed without Apple notarization. If
    Gatekeeper blocks this release and you trust the app, use:
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway

    Do not clear quarantine attributes or disable Gatekeeper.

    Launch Cachewatch before running setup:
      open -a Cachewatch

    Then connect it to Claude Code's statusline (idempotent and backed up):
      cachewatch setup

    Cachewatch is menu-bar-only; it has no Dock icon or normal app window.
